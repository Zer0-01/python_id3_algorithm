# ID3 Algorithm Implementation in Python

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of the ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) algorithm in Python. ID3 is a decision tree algorithm that builds a tree by recursively selecting the best attribute to split the data at each node. The goal is to create a tree that predicts the target variable as accurately as possible.

## Features

- **ID3 Algorithm Implementation:** The core of this project is the implementation of the ID3 algorithm in Python, allowing users to build decision trees for classification tasks.

- **Customizable Parameters:** Users can customize various parameters of the ID3 algorithm, such as the splitting criteria, stopping conditions, and handling missing values.
